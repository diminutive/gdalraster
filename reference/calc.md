# Raster calculation

`calc()` evaluates an R expression for each pixel in a raster layer or
stack of layers. Each layer is defined by a raster filename or dataset
object, band number, and a variable name to use in the R expression. If
not specified, band defaults to `1` for each input raster. Variable
names default to `LETTERS` if not specified (`A` (layer 1), `B` (layer
2), ...). All of the input layers must have the same extent and cell
size. The projection will be read from the first raster in the list of
inputs. Individual pixel coordinates are also available as variables in
the R expression, as either x/y in the raster projected coordinate
system or inverse projected longitude/latitude. Multi-band output is
supported as of gdalraster 1.11.0.

## Usage

``` r
calc(
  expr,
  rasterfiles,
  bands = NULL,
  var.names = NULL,
  dstfile = tempfile("rastcalc", fileext = ".tif"),
  fmt = NULL,
  dtName = "Int16",
  out_band = 1L,
  options = NULL,
  nodata_value = NULL,
  setRasterNodataValue = FALSE,
  write_mode = "safe",
  quiet = FALSE,
  return_obj = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- expr:

  An R expression as a character string (e.g., `"A + B"`).

- rasterfiles:

  Input rasters, either a character vector of filenames, or a list with
  each element either a filename as character string or an object of
  class `GDALRaster` (must be an open dataset for the latter).

- bands:

  Integer vector of band numbers to use for each raster layer.

- var.names:

  Character vector of variable names to use for each raster layer.

- dstfile:

  Either a character string with the output raster filename, or an
  object of class `GDALRaster` with which to write output. If given as
  an object, the dataset must be open for write access, and the
  arguments below related to raster creation are ignored (i.e., `fmt`,
  `dtName`, `options`, `setRasterNodataValue`). The `write_mode` must be
  set to `"update"` for writing with an existing dataset object.

- fmt:

  Output raster format name (e.g., "GTiff" or "HFA"). Will attempt to
  guess from the output filename if not specified.

- dtName:

  Character name of output data type (e.g., Byte, Int16, UInt16, Int32,
  UInt32, Float32).

- out_band:

  Integer band number(s) in `dstfile` for writing output. Defaults to
  `1L`. Multi-band output is supported as of gdalraster 1.11.0, in which
  case `out_band` would be a vector of band numbers.

- options:

  Optional list of format-specific creation options in a vector of
  "NAME=VALUE" pairs (e.g., `options = c("TILED=YES", "COMPRESS=LZW")`
  to set LZW compression during creation of a tiled GTiff file).

- nodata_value:

  Numeric value to assign if `expr` returns `NA`.

- setRasterNodataValue:

  Logical value. `TRUE` will attempt to set the raster format nodata
  value to `nodata_value`, or `FALSE` not to set a raster nodata value
  on the output dataset.

- write_mode:

  Character string. Name of the file write mode for output. One of:

  - `safe` - execution stops if `dstfile` already exists (no output
    written)

  - `overwrite` - if `dstfile` exists it will be overwritten with a new
    file

  - `update` - if `dstfile` exists, will attempt to open in update mode,
    or write to the existing dataset if `dstfile` is given as an object

- quiet:

  Logical value. If `TRUE`, a progress bar and informational messages
  will not be displayed. Defaults to `FALSE`.

- return_obj:

  Logical value. If `TRUE`, an object of class
  [`GDALRaster`](https://firelab.github.io/gdalraster/reference/GDALRaster-class.md)
  opened on the newly created dataset will be returned. The default is
  `FALSE`.

- ...:

  Additional arguments, none currently supported.

## Value

By default, returns the output filename invisibly. An object of class
[`GDALRaster`](https://firelab.github.io/gdalraster/reference/GDALRaster-class.md)
open on the output dataset will be returned if `return_obj = TRUE`.

## Details

The variables in `expr` are vectors of length raster xsize (i.e., row
vectors of the input raster layer(s), with length the number of raster
columns). The expression should return a vector also of length raster
xsize (an output row). Four special variable names are available in
`expr`: `pixelX` and `pixelY` provide pixel center coordinates in
projection units. `pixelLon` and `pixelLat` can also be used, in which
case the pixel x/y coordinates will be inverse projected to
longitude/latitude (in the same geographic coordinate system used by the
input projection, which is read from the first input raster). Note that
inverse projection adds computation time.

To refer to specific bands in a multi-band input file, repeat the
filename or dataset object in `rasterfiles` and specify corresponding
band numbers in `bands`, along with optional variable names in
`var.names`, e.g.,

    rasterfiles = c("multiband.tif", "multiband.tif")
    bands = c(4, 5)
    var.names = c("B4", "B5")

Output will be written to `dstfile`. To update a file that already
exists, set `write_mode = "update"` and set `out_band` to an existing
band number(s) in `dstfile` (new bands cannot be created in `dstfile`).
`dstfile` can optionally be given as an object of class `GDALRaster`
open for write access.

To write multi-band output, `expr` must return a vector of values
interleaved by band. This is equivalent to, and can also be returned as,
a matrix `m` with `nrow(m)` equal to
[`length()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html) of an input vector, and
`ncol(m)` equal to the number of output bands. In matrix form, each
column contains a vector of output values for a band. `length(m)` must
be equal to the [`length()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html) of an
input vector multiplied by `length(out_band)`. The dimensions described
above are assumed and not read from the return value of `expr`.

# phenological occurrence of springtime. Here it is relativized to
# mean values for an eight-state region in the western US.
# Positive HI means spring is delayed by that number of days relative
# to the reference position, while negative values indicate spring is
# advanced. The original equation had elevation units as feet, so
